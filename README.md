## Identify Factors that Correlational. 
### A Supervised Learning Project.   

*This project adds a predictive model for understanding the dynamics of gender, age, employment status in intro base analytics at Github5. This work builds on previous research done by my mentor Wasim*. 

I did a mixed-methods formative research that answers the question, “What are the factors that lead lenders to categorize workmen choose loan amount and know whether the workmen will be a risky one based on age, employment status, state, firm name, gender, $Claimant.Marital.Status,$Average.Weekly.Wage, ”

## Analysis
An analysis of this project is open for all    
The technical implementation can be found in:
